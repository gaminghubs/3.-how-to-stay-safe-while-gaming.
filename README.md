 How to stay safe while gaming online is crucial to ensure a positive and secure gaming experience. Here are some tips to help you stay safe:

1. Create Complex Passwords for Your Gaming Accounts
A unique, randomly generated password with a minimum of 16 characters for each gaming account helps protect you from numerous dangers like brute force attacks, credential stuffing, and other password-related breaches. We advocate utilising a password manager because remembering unique passwords for all of your accounts is very impossible. A password manager employs an encrypted vault to securely create and store passwords, which is protected by a single master password that you must remember.

2. Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).
MFA necessitates an extra way of authentication, often a code given via an authenticator app, to prevent unwanted access to your account even if your credentials are compromised. Because of the popularity of cyberattacks in online gaming, most online gaming sites have customised MFA solutions.

A good password manager can also assist you in managing your MFA codes.



3. Make use of a VPN (Virtual Private Network).
Online gamers may avoid VPNs because they are concerned about a slowdown in gameplay caused by encrypted internet traffic. However, a good VPN that uses modern security methods should not have a substantial impact on your internet performance. A VPN, which is especially handy for online gamers, can disguise your IP address from potentially hazardous enemies on live gaming platforms, protecting your location.A VPN conceals both your location and your traffic, which is critical in fighting  doxxed  and swatting assaults.

4. Select an Anonymous Username.
Birthdates, names (including middle names), age, and other personal information are frequently included in PII (personally identifiable information). Threat actors can exploit this seemingly innocuous information to attack you online. Choose a fully anonymous pseudonym to avoid online gamers from linking your account to your actual name via a digital trace.

5. Do not share personally identifiable information (PII).
While collaborating on gaming objectives, online gamers may form friendships or engage in chats with other gamers. However, just because you've won together doesn't mean you can trust your gaming partner with your personal information.
Even if you provide ambiguous responses, avoid revealing your PII with other people. If necessary, lying in response to such questions is a viable method for discouraging dangerous actors from discovering who you are and where you are.

6.Keep Your Gaming Software Up to Date
Security patches that address known vulnerabilities are frequently included in software updates. Cybercriminals frequently target consumers right after security updates are issued, trying to hack devices before users can update and secure them. This is also true with video game software. Download all software updates as soon as possible.
7. Learn to Spot Common Scams
Phishing, spoofing, and virus attacks abound in the online gaming sector. Keeping up with news from legitimate sources, such as the company behind your favourite games or gaming news websites, can help you identify typical scams. Being aware of the most recent scams will help you avoid falling victim to them.
8. Make purchases with credit cards
Credit cards provide superior fraud protection than debit cards, making them ideal for online purchases, including video game stores like Steam or Nintendo eShop.
9. Only download and play games from reputable sources.
Games obtained for free or at a reduced price from pirated websites or other unofficial sources may contain malware and other cyber dangers. Only download games from official sources; postponing the download of suspicious game files is preferable than endangering your machine and data.
10. Block Suspicious or Aggressive People
If a user you encounter online acts strangely, sends dubious links, or harasses you, block them immediately. Such conduct can lead to targeted attacks, endangering your cyber, physical, and emotional well-being. Ignoring them may be tempting, but blocking the user ensures that they no longer have access to your account information, lowering the chance of cyber threats.
11. Modify the Default Privacy Settings
On most video game systems, the default privacy settings are the least restrictive. To keep yourself safe online, evaluate the settings when opening a new account and choose more restrictive ones."
